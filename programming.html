<ul>
    <h3>Phases of Computer Program Development</h3>
    <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in an appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
    <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
    <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
    <li>Phase 6: Test program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
    <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h3>Programming Structures</h3>
    <li>Sequential structures: Top-down execution</li>
    <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
    <h4>Interative (looping):</h4>
    <li>While loop: Continue looping as long as something is true</li>
    <li>Repeat/until loop: Continue looping until something is true</li>
    <li>For loop: Loop a given number of times</li>
    <h3>Recursive structures</h3>
    <li>Repeat a set of instructions</li>
    <li>Repetition continues until:</li>
    <li>Degenerative case (also known as a "base case"), which is a termination condition, is met</li>
    <h3>Two classic programming/database problems:</h3>
    <h4>Sorting: Descending/ascending order:</h4>
    <li>Sorting numbers</li>
    <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
    <h4>Searching: Find specific data that meets a certain criteria</h4>
    <h5>In database:</h5>
    <li>Filters: Temporary search</li>
    <li>Queries: Serch criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
    <h5>Two popular search techniques:</h5>
    <li>Sequential search: Search from top to bottom or vice versa</li>
    <li>Binary search: (Only works if data is sorted first) Starts in the middle, then go half of that, etc.</li>
    <h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
    <li>Efficency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
    <li>Correctness: Program runs as expected and works for all expected conditions</li>
    <h3>Software Testing and Verifications</h3>
    <h4>Kind of tests:</h4>
    <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying if the whole system works as intended</li>
    <li>Integration testing: Verifying that software components and functions work together</li>
    <li>Unit testing:Validating that each software unit performs as expected (a unit is the smallest testable component of an application)</li>
    <li>Functional testing:Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements</li>
    <li>Performance testing: Testing how the software works under different workloads</li>
    <li>Regression testing: Checking whether or not new features break or degrade functionally</li>
    <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails</li>
    <li>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use the system to complete a task</li>
    <h4>Software testing is done to detect:</h4>
    <li>Arcitechtual flaws</li>
    <li>Poor design decisions</li>
    <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
    <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
    <h4>Best testing pracvtices:</h4>
    <li>Continuous testing: Project teams test each build as it becomes available</li>
    <li>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test</li>
    <li>Service visualization: Simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner</li>
    <li>Defect or "bug tracking": Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues</li>
    <li>Metrics and reporting: Allows teams to track issuesReporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results</li>
