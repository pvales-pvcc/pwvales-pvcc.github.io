    <h2>What is US Code, and why is it important?</h2>
    <li>Originally established in 1926, the US Code is a compilation of every commonly enforced US law, broken down and categorized into different subsections. Every six years, an entirely new edition of the US Code is printed, and supplemental updates are provided every year in the interim. The US code is important, as it catalogs federal law in order to help determine the current or past laws on a certain subject matter.</li>
    <h2>How is it decided what laws are codified into the US Code?</h2>
    <li>It all depends on the situation. For example, a law changing the name of a local park would not be added to the US code, as that is not of significance to US law. But if a law is codified on a federal level, such as a new immigration law, or a law changing the tax brackets, that would be included in the US code in one of the supplemental revisions, then added to the new edition once the six-year cycle comes to a close.</li>
    <h2>What are positive and non-positive laws, and what is the difference?</h2>
    <li>A positive law title is a federal statute, and a non-positive law title is an editorial compilation of federal statutes. For example, Title 10, “The Armed Forces”, is a positive law title, as it has already been enacted, but Title 42, “The Public Health and Welfare”, is non-positive. The key difference between positive and non-positive laws is that non-positive law titles are prima-facie (correct until proven otherwise) evidence of the law, but positive titles constitute concrete, legal evidence of the law. Non-positive law titles can be rebutted by showing contradictions written into other statutes, but a positive law is an authoritative truth until the law is changed. </li>
    <h2>How is it decided what is justified as a US Code, and how often are updates made?</h2>
    <li>By Congress! Congress votes on laws, and then the Office of Law Revision Counsel decides where the laws voted upon by Congress fall within the US Code. As touched upon earlier, the US Code is updated completely by a new edition, which is created every six years, but generally, the written US Code is amended to include whatever laws were voted into effect anywhere from six weeks to a year after the end of a session of Congress.</li>
    <h2>When do laws go into effect? </h2>
    <li>Unless stated otherwise, a law in the US Code becomes an enforceable law on the day of enactment, which is often included in a section added to the US Code. For example, if a new agricultural law is added to the US Code, at the end of it, it will say something along the lines of “Date enacted: May 1, 2023”, which means the code will become law on May 1, 2023.</li>
    <h2>How do I search for a specific US Code?</h2>
    <li>You can go to the <a href= "https://uscode.house.gov/">US Office of Law Revision Counsel Webpage </a> and from there, you can search the title and section of the law you are looking for, or click through the menus until you find what you are looking for.</a></li>
    <h2>What are the US Codes?</h2>
    <li>Currently, there are 55 titles of the US Code (53 active, 1 reserved). Interestingly, as you read through the additional Codes created as time has passed, you can actually see several points in which the code mirrors major events in US History. Below is a compilation of every US Code title, in order, beginning with the first codes written in 1926.</li>
